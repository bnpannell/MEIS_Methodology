# For file in temp, load in data obtained from "obtain_usaspending"- need to make it selects without knowing the name OR potential additional files in folder we are un interested in
#Assistance and Contracts files need to be processed and saved separately due to subsequent processes
#Filter both files by Recipient and Planed Performance location, both in the state of CA- check location variables and document
#Output filtered data with new name into temp folder- follow some output format. Define name in parameters file
