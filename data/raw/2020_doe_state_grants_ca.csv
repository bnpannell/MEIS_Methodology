OPUS 12 PROPOSES TO BUILD A >100 CELL STACK OF >1,500 CM2 ELECTRODE AREA MEMBRANE-ELECTRODE ASSEMBLIES (MEAS) BASED ON THE EXISTING MW-SCALE PEM WATER ELECTROLYZER DESIGN OF OPUS 12’S MANUFACTURING PARTNER, NEL HYDROGEN. PERFORMER WILL DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM ONSITE USING CO2 EMISSIONS FROM A STEAM METHANE REFORMER (SMR) OPERATED BY COMMERCIALIZATION PARTNER, SOCALGAS, THE LARGEST NATURAL GAS UTILITY IN THE US. THE SYSTEM WOULD GENERATE OVER 500 KG/DAY OF CO. THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE THE LARGEST CO2 ELECTROLYZER BUILT TO DATE AND WOULD BE A MAJOR MILESTONE IN DEMONSTRATING THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHEMICAL AND ENERGY INDUSTRIES.

BORDEAUX, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON, AND UNIV. LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA. WE PROPOSE TO USE THE OMEGA FACILITY FOR A BASIC RESEARCH INVESTIGATION INTO THE PLASMA DYNAMICS OF MAGNETIZED CYLINDRICAL IMPLOSIONS WITH A SEED B-FIELD OF AT LEAST 50 T GENERATED BY LASER-DRIVEN CAPACITOR-COIL TARGETS (CCT).

THE LAYOUT OF OUR EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE. A 20 ΜM-THICK, 300 ΜM-RADIUS PLASTIC CYLINDER FILLED WITH DEUTERIUM-GAS AT 11 ATM PRESSURE (IN LINE WITH RECENT MINI-MAGLIF OMEGA EXPERIMENTS) WILL BE IMPLODED BY 40 OMEGA LONG PULSE LASERS (15 KJ IN UV), WITH THE SEED B-FIELD AND WITHOUT IT, FOR REFERENCE. THE SEED WILL BE GENERATED BY TWO CCTS, CCTS.

THE D2 WILL BE DOPED WITH ARGON IN ORDER TO USE THE WELL-CHARACTERIZED K-SHELL X-RAY LINE EMISSION THROUGHOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE IMPLOSION AND AT STAGNATION TO EXTRACT PLASMA CONDITIONS. THE KSHELL SPECTRUM IS SENSITIVE TO PLASMA CONDITIONS THROUGH THE TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY SENSITIVITY OF THE ATOMIC LEVEL POPULATION KINETICS AND THE DENSITY DEPENDENCE OF THE STARK-BROADENED LINE SHAPES. SPECTRA WILL BE COMPARED FOR SHOTS WITH AND WITHOUT THE SEED B-FIELD. THE EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS WILL BE COMPARED TO FLASH AND GORGON MHD SIMULATIONS, COUPLED TO STATE-OF-THE-ART CALCULATIONS OF ATOMIC EMISSION LINE SHAPE, MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AND RADIATION TRANSPORT THROUGH THE IMPLODED PLASMAS. PRELIMINARY MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMIC (MHD) SIMULATIONS PREDICT CORE MAGNETIZATIONS TO WELL ABOVE 10 KT.

THE DEVELOPED PLATFORM WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND THE RANGE OF ACHIEVABLE MAGNETIZATION LEVELS, ENABLING OTHER EXPERIMENTS AT THE FACILITY TO STUDY EFFECTS OF STRONG MAGNET FIELDS IN HED EXPERIMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE WORK WILL OPEN THE POSSIBILITY TO BENCHMARK THE NUMERICAL TOOLS AND IN PARTICULAR IMPROVE THEIR PREDICTABILITY IN TERMS OF THE NON-LOCAL B-FIELD TRANSPORT WITH THE HEAT FLOW (NERNST EFFECT) AND THERMAL TRANSPORT NORMAL TO THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT (RIGHI-LEDUC EFFECT). NOTABLE IMPACTS OF BENCHMARKING THE VALIDITY OF MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC MODELING WILL BE TO ADVANCE THE MAGNETIZED LINER INERTIAL FUSION (MAGLIF) ADVANCED FUSION SCHEME AND OTHER 
APPLICATIONS SUCH AS LABORATORY-BASED ASTROPHYSICAL JETS.

THE PROPOSED WORK INVOLVES BASIC LASER–MATTER INTERACTION, AND HIGH ENERGY DENSITY PHYSICS AND HAS POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION. THE COLLABORATION WILL BENEFIT A NUMBER OF EARLY-CAREER SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THE WORK (TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FOUR POSTDOCS) AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY EDUCATED IN SCIENCE RELEVANT TO STOCKPILE STEWARDSHIP. THUS, THE PROJECT WILL HELP FULFILL BOTH NLUF PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. THE PROPOSED 
EXPERIMENTS ADDRESS BASIC SCIENCE ISSUES IN THE TECHNICAL SCOPE AND TOPICAL RESEARCH AREAS DEFINED IN THE NLUF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT MAGNETIZED HIGH ENERGY DENSITY PLASMAS AND ALSO CONSTITUTES DIAGNOSTIC AND EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,,,B,CONTINUATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DENA0003940_8900/,2020-07-28 20:33:04.630988+00
