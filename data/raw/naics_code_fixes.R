##Pseudo Code for file
# Walk through error code files and assign values based on words used in activity description section

#Construction codes with "REPAIR" "REPLACE" "REPLACEMENT" "INSTALL" largely fit into "60" or "61" for example
# Fix as many as we can then see what is left of the "error" files
