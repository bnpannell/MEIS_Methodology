## To do List for rest of project
(delete as items are completed- delete entire file once project is complete)

1. Go into library REPO and delete notes from src files

2. Document census parameters in Readme

3. Keep redoing census call from scratch on back burner

4. Add Log File to API calls (talk to Patrick about how this works)

7. Error check and weight census: Double check new business crosswalk for contracts without District values - document how this was done and the logic behind it.

8. NAICS crosswalk that includes 2007, 2002 and 2012 codes figured out, document how this data is obtained including lookup website for NAICS

9. Deal with Construction NAICS codes- using the justification that if we dont find 'maintainence words' we assume is newer construction and we put it in a bin that seems correct based on the multipliers used by IMPLAN in the 'enter 1 million $ test' and split the difference. 

10. Error check Grants: Need a crosswalk to fix grant errors where no district is assigned (but there are few so yay)

11. Will need to add better instructions for dealing with fixes. IE - pull out error entries. Make fix file (if needed) save fix file(s) and run fix code and make sure it reconcats fixes back to main code block.

12. Generate employment dataframe will need edits
