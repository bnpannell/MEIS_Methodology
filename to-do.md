## To do List for rest of project
(delete as items are completed- delete entire file once project is complete)

1. Figure out how to handle NAICS errors
  - Ask Devin how to handle construction codes and 92 series codes, hard code them if possible and emit them from error output that way

  
2. DONE
  
3. Double check no NAICS code industries repair code - this will just have to be hard coded. Don't see a way around it

4. DONE
   
5. Mostly DONE, still need new code made to handle grant specific DISTRICT values being 90, already have contracts industry fixes finished

6. Take a look into SmartPay
  - Will probably need to explain A LOT about the process we used to distribute SmartPay spending across the agencies
  - Maybe make as an optional piece?
  
7. Start looking at employment data
  - Is this all stuff to be hard coded? Documentation will be rough, take extensive notes
  
8. Final steps will be making sure all outputs are ready for IMPLAN - do we want to provide the file schemas to run the final code bits?

9. Go through and re-outline the documentation, make sure to go over old notes to ensure nothing tricky or different was left out of the documentation
  - Readme file should be finalized first, and documentation structured off of it for a start
  
10. Finalize documentation repo and add in html links etc

11. Get Devin and Tom to proof read, apply edits and get ready for publishing. 

12. Priority goes to getting documentation ready for how we did it for 2021 data- then going into detail on how subsequent years will work
    based on modifications and efficiences worked into new code
